# Dynamic function mocks

## GetStdHandle

replace GetStdHandle(nStdHandle) by
  case nStdHandle is
    -10: eax := 23
    -11: eax := 27
      _: assert false
  end
  return
end

## WriteFile

replace WriteFile(hFile, _, nNumberOfBytesToWrite, lpNumberOfBytesWritten, lpOverlapped) by
  assert hFile = 27
  assert lpOverlapped = 0
  if lpNumberOfBytesWritten <> 0 then
    @[lpNumberOfBytesWritten, 4] := nNumberOfBytesToWrite
  end
  return 1
end

## ReadFile

replace ReadFile(hFile, lpBuffer, nNumberOfBytesToRead, lpNumberOfBytesRead, lpOverlapped) by
  # assume ReadFile is only used to read in STD_INPUT_HANDLE
  assert hFile = 23
  assert lpOverlapped = 0
  # create a symbolic value and add a constraint to the number of read bytes
  nNumberOfBytesRead<32> := nondet
  assume 2 <= nNumberOfBytesRead <= nNumberOfBytesToRead
  for i<32> in 0 to nNumberOfBytesRead - 3 do
    # create a new symbolic byte in the byte stream bRead
    @[lpBuffer + i] := nondet as bRead
    # such that it is printable
    assume " " <= bRead <= "~"
  end
  # mimic the 'enter' keystroke
  @[lpBuffer + i] := "\r"
  @[lpBuffer + i + 1] := "\n"
  # write the result in the pointer passed in argument, if any
  if lpNumberOfBytesRead <> 0 then
    @[lpNumberOfBytesRead, 4] := nNumberOfBytesRead
  end
  # return a non zero value
  return 1
end

# Goals

reach WriteFile such that @[@[esp + 8, 4], 15] = "You are success"
then print ascii stream bRead

cut at WriteFile if @[@[esp + 8, 4], 15] = "You are failure"
cut at return_address
